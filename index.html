<h1>NMS S.Vellaichamy Nadar College</h1>

<p>
        Nadar Mahajana Sangam S.Vellaichamy Nadar College, a first grade college, affiliated to the Madurai Kamaraj University, is situated at the foot of the historic Nagamalai hills on the Madurai – Theni trunk road, spreading over 44 acres in a picturesque landscape.

        The college was started in 1965 by the “Nadar Mahajana Sangam, Madurai ” with the encouragement of the generous donations received from philanthropic members of the sangam. Kodaivallal, kalvithanthai Thiru. S. Vellaichamy Nadar of Virudhunagar has contributed largely for the creation of this institution by his enthusiastic assistance in all ways. In order to perpetuate his pleasant memory, this college was named after him.
        
        The college was inaugurated on 20th july 1965 by our beloved leader ‘Bharat Rathna' Thiru.K.Kamaraj. Today this co-education citadel of learning has developed into a postgraduate and research institution aiming at imparting quality education with main emphasis on conduct and character development.
        
        Eventhough it was started by the Nadar Mahajana Sangam, the institution caters to the needs of all the members of public without any distinction of caste, creed or religion.
        
        Our college is a Co-educational, Autonomous and ISO 9001-2008 certified institution and is re-accredited with "A" grade by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), Bangalore.
        
        The college has planned its work so as to have a well integrated scheme of instruction, tutorial help and personal guidance coupled with healthy life and community activities to suit individual needs. The object is to develop in the students habits of punctuality and sense of responsibility so that they may come out as worthy citizens of India.
